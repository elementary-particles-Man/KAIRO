# Mesh Node Roles

This directory defines role configurations for KAIRO Mesh nodes.

## Adding a New Role
1. Create a new YAML file in this directory.
2. Use the same structure as the existing roles:
   - `role_name`
   - `description`
   - `permissions`
   - `system_fingerprint`
3. Commit the file and describe the role's purpose.
