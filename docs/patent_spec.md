## Title
Secure Multi-Agent Communication Protocol with Override-Based Governance

## Abstract
A method and system for secure communication between autonomous software agents using cryptographic signatures and quorum-based override logic to maintain verifiable integrity across a dynamic network of identities.

## Claims
1. An identity system based on persistent P-addresses with cryptographic signature verification.
2. A multisignature override mechanism for reissuing IDs and system parameters.
3. A zoning protocol for ethical containment of propagating information across agents.

## Diagrams
(To be appended from VOV UI prototype)

## Implementation Notes
This invention is implemented in Rust and TypeScript using ed25519-dalek and WASM-compatible UI bridges.
