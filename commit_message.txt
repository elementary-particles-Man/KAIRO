Fix: Resolve compilation and test errors in rust-core

This commit addresses several compilation and test failures in the `rust-core` package.

Key changes include:
- Updated `rand` and `rand_core` dependencies to compatible versions.
- Corrected `LogRecorder::new()` and `rotate_key()` usage in tests.
- Fixed `Sha256Signature` tampering logic in tests.
- Adjusted `SigningKey` and `Signature` usage in tests to align with `ed25519-dalek` API.
- Resolved `packet_validator` issues related to `map` and `collect`.
- Removed duplicate `coordination.rs` and `packet_validator` module declarations.
- Ensured `uuid` crate features are correctly specified.
- Removed `test_link.rs` as it was causing linking errors and is no longer needed.
