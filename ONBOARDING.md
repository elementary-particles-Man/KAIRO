# The Constitution of the KAIRO Mesh Network

## One for THE WORLD, THE WORLD for One.

## Welcome to the Mesh

This document outlines the fundamental principles for any new entity wishing to join the KAIRO mesh network, all of which are derived from the single, immutable law stated above.

### Core Philosophy

1.  **The Mesh is Alive:** The rules and protocols of this network are not static. They are expected to evolve through the consensus of participating nodes. What is true today may be improved tomorrow.

2.  **The First Handshake is Sacred:** While the rules are mutable, the process of joining the mesh for the first time must always be clear, transparent, and explicitly documented. This guide serves as that first, immutable handshake.

### How to Join

1.  **Read the RFCs:** Start with `docs/RFC/AI-TCP_RFC_mesh_layered_architecture.md` to understand the layered architecture.
2.  **Generate Your ID:** Follow the protocol for generating a self-signed static ID (Layer 1 of the WAU model).
3.  **Find a Seed Node:** Use the publicly listed Seed Nodes to initiate your first connection.
4.  **Undergo Peer Review:** Engage with the mesh according to the WAU protocol to build your trust score and find your place within the community.

## How to Use: First Onboarding with CUI

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the provided CUI (`setup_agent`).
3. The CUI will:
   - Generate your static ID (key pair).
   - Register you to the Seed Node.
   - Output your Agent Token and Mesh Address.

4. Keep your Agent Token safe.
5. Launch AI-TCP using this token.
6. Your trust score starts from zero and grows via Peer Review.
