[workspace]
members = [
    "rust-core"
]

# ✅ ポイント
# - ルートに共通 dev-dependencies は定義せず
# - 各メンバー（rust-core）側に dev-dependencies を寄せて管理
#   （例: criterion, mockall, rstest など）

# もし将来、共通 dev-dependencies を workspace でまとめるなら
# [workspace.dependencies] で整理
# 例:
# [workspace.dependencies]
# criterion = "0.5"
